Chat Bot with Question Answering and Knowledge Base
This Python script implements a chat bot that utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques for question answering. The bot is equipped with a knowledge base and can also generate answers using the GPT-2 language model.

Features
Question Answering with BERT: Utilizes the IndoBERT model for question answering.
GPT-2 Answer Generation: Generates answers using the GPT-2 language model.
Knowledge Base: Maintains a knowledge base in a JSON file.
Tfidf Vectorization: Finds similar questions in the knowledge base using TF-IDF vectorization.
Google Search Integration: Conducts a Google search when a similar question is not found in the knowledge base.
User Interaction: Allows the user to correct and update the knowledge base during the conversation.
Setup
Install the required Python packages:
pip install requirements.txt
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers torch spacy sentence_transformers google googlesearch-python beautifulsoup4 textwrap3
Download the GPT-2 and IndoBERT models using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Ensure you have the necessary data files. In this example, a CSV file named Conversation.csv is used.

Usage
Run the script in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
The chat bot will prompt you for input. Type your questions or enter "quit" to exit the conversation.

Knowledge Base Management
During the conversation, if the bot provides an inaccurate response, you can correct it by entering "no" when prompted. The bot will then ask for the corrected response, update the knowledge base, and thank you for the correction.

The knowledge base is saved in a JSON file named knowledge_base.json.

Feel free to customize the script based on your specific use case and knowledge base requirements.







Discord Chat Bot Integration
This Python script integrates the previously developed chat bot into a Discord bot using the discord.py library. The Discord bot responds to user messages and provides answers based on the chat bot's capabilities.

Features
Integration with Discord: Utilizes the discord.py library to create a Discord bot.
Answering User Queries: Responds to user messages by processing them through the chat bot's question-answering functionality.
Private Messaging: Allows users to send private messages to the bot by prefixing messages with '?'.
Error Handling: Catches and prints any exceptions that occur during the bot's operation.
Setup
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install discord
Ensure you have the TOKEN variable correctly set in the note.py file. This token is required for authenticating the Discord bot.

Make sure the main.py and note.py files are in the same directory as this script.

Usage
Run the script in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
The Discord bot will log in and be ready to respond to messages in the Discord server.

Interacting with the Bot
To ask a question or get a response from the bot, simply type a message in the Discord server.
If you want to send a private message to the bot, prefix your message with '?'.
Error Handling
If any exceptions occur during the bot's operation, they will be printed to the console. Make sure to review these messages to identify and address any issues.

Feel free to customize the script based on your specific Discord server and chat bot requirements. Additionally, you can extend the functionality of the bot to include more advanced features or commands.
